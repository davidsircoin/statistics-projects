# Designs
## Complete Randomised

> [!def] Complete Randomised Design
> Treatment levels are randomly assigned across the whole sample.

## Matched Pairs

> [!def] Matched-Pairs Design
> Given a single treatment with two levels, a **matched-pairs** design creates pairs of subjects (possibly the same subject in the case of replicate measures) where the components received opposite treatment levels.

The pairing and who receives the treatment need not be random, e.g. pairing the same subject with themselves before and after a treatment. Typically the paired subjects are related in some meaningful way or so as to control for confounds by pairing subjects with the same or similar confound measures.

## Randomised-Block

> [!def] Randomised Block Design
> Blocking the subjects before admistering treatment and then randomly assigning treatment levels within each block.

Our aim is to control for confounding.
